<p class="lead">The Open Knowledge Data Packager is a web app for easily
creating and publishing Tabular Data Packages.</p>

<h2>Tabular Data Packages</h2>

<p><abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> (comma-separated values) is the ultimate simple, standard
data format, and is supported by almost every spreadsheet program,
relational database and programming language. But <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> has limited
expressivity (a <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> file can't contain annotations, for example).
</p>

<p>Spreadsheet file formats (such as that used by Microsoft Excel)
have the expressivity, but are complicated and difficult to
process.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/tabular-data-package/">Tabular Data Package</a>
format is a good compromise between <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> and Excel. A tabular data
package is a <abbr class="initialism">ZIP</abbr> file of <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files, plus a
<code>datapackage.json</code> file containing metadata about the
<abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files. This metadata can include the title, description,
keywords and license of the data package, and also metadata about
the contents of the <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files such as descriptions and data types
of the columns, primary keys, and foreign key relationships
between different <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files in the package.</p>

<h2>The Open Knowledge Data Packager</h2>

<p><a href="{{ g.site_url }}">The Open Knowledge Data Packager</a> is a web app
for quickly generating tabular data packages and their metadata from a
collection of <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files on your hard drive.
You can create a data package, upload some <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr>
files to it, enter some metadata about the package and its files, and get a web
page where users can explore your data package, preview the contents of its
<abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files, and download the package as a <abbr
class="initialism">ZIP</abbr> file.</p>

<p>The Data Packager also generates some metadata for you
automatically, for example column names and types are inferred
from the contents of the <abbr class="initialism">CSV</abbr> files that you upload, some
descriptive statistics are computed for columns with numerical
data (number of rows, mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum
values...) and temporal extents (earliest and latest times) are
computed for columns containing dates or times.</p>

<p>When entering or editing metadata, the Data Packager's
validation ensures that you don't enter any invalid data, and
provides helpful error messages when you do.</p>

<p>All of the above functionality is also available through the
<a href="{% url_for 'api' %}">Data Packager's JSON API</a>.</p>
