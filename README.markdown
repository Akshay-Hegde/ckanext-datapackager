This is a CKAN extension that contains the CKAN theme and plugins for the B2
Metadata Generator.

This is currently meant to work with the CKAN branch
[b2](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/compare/release-v2.2...b2).
This is a branch currently based off the `release-v2.2` branch that includes
CKAN core changes that B2 depends on (hopefully these changes can be
contributed back into CKAN master and eventually B2 won't need its own branch.)
